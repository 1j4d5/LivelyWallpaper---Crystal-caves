# LivelyWallpaper---Crystal-caves

# Introduction

I recently discovered a free wallpaper engine and noticed a limited selection of wallpapers available. Inspired by this, I created a custom wallpaper using a code snippet from CodePen. The features offered by this lively wallpaper are truly amazing. 🚀

With the customization function from lively wallpapers, I added the following features that can be controlled:

1. **BoxCount:** Increases the amount of crystals that generate. 💎
2. **Spotlight:** Controls the light effect on the cursor's radius. ✨
3. **Movement Speed:** Controls the movement of the crystals. 🏃‍♂️
4. **Turbo Speed:** Controls the speed when the cursor is far away from the middle. 🚄
